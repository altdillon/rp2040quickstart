# rp2040quickstart
### RP2040 quick start for rp2040 projects.
Recently I started getting more interested in devloping for the RP2040. This is a quick start project that I made to setup debugging using the vscode ide.

### Vscode extentions
[ms cmake tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools)
[cortex-debug](https://github.com/Marus/cortex-debug)

### other stuff..
- I normally run a Linux box, so my .vscode launch.json and settings.json may not work on windows
- I will eventually move to a custom devlopment board to better suite my needs as I learn more about the rp2040 and starting building more projects with it.
